## üéõÔ∏è **Configuration Management**

### **Swagger APIs for All Services:**
- **Speech**: `http://raspberrypi:5001/swagger` - Voice selection, emotion tuning, engine switching
- **Vision**: `http://raspberrypi:5002/swagger` - Camera config, monitoring control, filter status  
- **Orchestrator**: `http://raspberrypi:5000/swagger` - Pipeline management, system status

### **Quality Presets:**
- `smooth_480p`: 640√ó480 @ 30fps (optimal for real-time)
- `balanced_720p`: 1280√ó720 @ 10fps (quality/speed balance)
- `high_quality_1080p`: 1920√ó1080 @ 5fps (maximum detail)

## ü¶Ä **Waldo Vision Integration**

### **Multi-Layer Analysis Engine:**
- **Temporal Analysis**: Learns normal environmental behavior patterns
- **Spatial Grouping**: Identifies coherent objects through heatmap clustering  
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Tracks object persistence and significance over time
- **Scene State Management**: Calibrating ‚Üí Stable ‚Üí Volatile ‚Üí Disturbed

### **Intelligent Triggering:**
- **CALIBRATING**: Learning phase (no triggers)
- **STABLE**: Static environment (no triggers, maximum cost savings)
- **VOLATILE**: Known movement (triggers disabled for reduced sensitivity)  
- **DISTURBED**: New actors/significant changes (triggers enabled, 0.25s cooldown)

---

## üìä **Performance Characteristics**

### **Real-time Processing:**
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps continuous capture and analysis
- **Latency**: Sub-second response to DISTURBED events (0.25s cooldown)
- **Efficiency**: 95%+ API call savings through intelligent filtering
- **Stability**: Crash-resistant with dynamic configuration and error handling

### **Cost Optimization:**
- **Without Filter**: ~108,000 API calls/hour (30fps √ó 3600s)
- **With Waldo Vision**: ~1,000-5,000 API calls/hour (DISTURBED events only)
- **Savings**: 95-99% reduction in AI API costs
- **Quality**: No reduction in response quality or accuracy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Limitations & Caveats**

### **üîß Operational Limitations:**
- **Camera Device Dependency**: Device IDs can change after USB reconnection
- **Service Interdependency**: No graceful degradation if one service fails  
- **Startup Order Sensitivity**: Vision service must start before monitoring
- **Manual Shutdown Required**: No graceful shutdown signal handling
- **Port Conflicts**: Hardcoded ports (5000, 5001, 5002) may conflict

### **üéõÔ∏è Configuration Constraints:**
- **API Keys Required**: Hume + Gemini API keys must be in environment
- **Internet Dependency**: Voice list fetching requires connectivity (101 API calls)
- **No Live Reconfiguration**: Most changes require service restart
- **Hardcoded Paths**: File paths and URLs not externally configurable

### **üìä Performance Caveats:**
- **Memory Growth**: Long-running monitoring may accumulate memory
- **Log File Growth**: No rotation, waldo_vision.log grows indefinitely
- **First Frame Delay**: Lazy Waldo Vision initialization causes initial latency
- **Rate Limiting**: No protection against Hume TTS rate limits (100/minute)

### **üêõ Error Handling Gaps:**
- **Silent Failures**: Some errors may not surface to user
- **No Persistence**: Scene learning resets on every restart  
- **Dimension Mismatches**: Defensive skipping, doesn't fix root cause
- **Thread Safety**: Potential race conditions under high load

### **üöß Incomplete Features:**
- **Audio Input**: Ears capability not implemented
- **Memory System**: No conversation or scene memory persistence
- **Mobile Interface**: No mobile app or remote control
- **Advanced Pipelines**: Multi-input fusion not implemented
- **Scene Understanding**: Limited to description, no object relationships

## üîÆ **For Future Developers:**

**Before extending the system:**
1. **Review API rate limits** and implement local rate limiting
2. **Add service health monitoring** with automatic restart capabilities  
3. **Implement configuration persistence** and live reconfiguration
4. **Add structured logging** with rotation and analysis capabilities
5. **Test camera reconnection scenarios** and add recovery logic
6. **Implement graceful shutdown** with proper cleanup sequences

**The system works well for its intended use case but has rough edges that should be smoothed for production deployment.** üõ†Ô∏è
